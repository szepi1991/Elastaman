# Elastaman

This is a simple game prototype for Android, using the AndEngine and in particular Box2D physics.

## History

I spent a couple of days learning about Android and working on this project during the christmas break of 2012. Unfortunately since then I have not touched it.
I'm adding the project to github in Sept 2014; At this point I have not seen any similar code for 2 years now, so I'm hoping it works as I left it.

At the time of working on the project I wrote a few notes online about things that came up, these are accessible at http://andventurez.blogspot.ca/ .
